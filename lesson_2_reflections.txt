What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A message is given by git telling me where is the new repository and a folder name .git is created where all metadata is stored.
We need a repository to track all changes of a project without having a lot of similar folders/files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stagin area is a layer that let me have more control over the changes I want to commit at once. It is different from working directory
in the sense it is contained in and it doesnt mean it will be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I think we can use git diff to evaluate the working directory vs stagging area and use git diff --staged to compare with the most recent commit, it isnt neccesary to commit all files.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I want to try experimental features, change languages, etc. Any big change that can affect the functionallity of the code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can know the parents of a commit and ensure where I can modified without affect the rest of the commit history

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When two branches are merging they show all the commit made. In the diagram is easy to follow all the history.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pros: You preserve exact the changes you want.
COns: It implies to read a lot of code
