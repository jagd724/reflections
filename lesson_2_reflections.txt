What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A message is given by git telling me where is the new repository and a folder name .git is created where all metadata is stored.
We need a repository to track all changes of a project without having a lot of similar folders/files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stagin area is a layer that let me have more control over the changes I want to commit at once. It is different from working directory
in the sense it is contained in and it doesnt mean it will be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I think we can use git diff to evaluate the working directory vs stagging area and use git diff --staged to compare with the most recent commit, it isnt neccesary to commit all files.
