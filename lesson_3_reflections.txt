When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working with others.
Just to contribute to a community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because a repository can be accessed by many people and
you do not want to have possible bugs in your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: Only works in github and it is similar to git clone: It copies a 
      repository into your git hub account.

Clone: Works in git. It copies a repository from github to a local machine 
	   or copy a repository in another location in the same machine.

Branch: It is just a method to label change into a repository.

I will use branches when I am working in a repository and want to try
some important changes that can affect the production version. Instead
I will use Clone if I want to collaborate with a github repository making
 changes in my local machine instead of using github website.
I will use fork if I want to copy a repository for free manipulation
without wating approvals of the creator.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
