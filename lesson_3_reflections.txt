When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working with others.
Just to contribute to a community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because a repository can be accessed by many people and
you do not want to have possible bugs in your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: Only works in github and it is similar to git clone: It copies a 
      repository into your git hub account.

Clone: Works in git. It copy a repository from github to a local machine 
	   or copy a repository in another location in the same machine.

Branch: It is just a method to label where you dont want commits be
		reachable by other commits, Like a tree branches :).
