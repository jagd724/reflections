When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working with others.
Just to contribute to a community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because a repository can be accessed by many people and you do not want to have possible bugs in your code.
